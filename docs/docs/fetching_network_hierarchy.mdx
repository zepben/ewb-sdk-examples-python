title: Fetching Network Hierarchy
---

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the `SyncNetworkConsumerClient` to connect to a gRPC service and fetch information about a network hierarchy from the EWB server.
The code is organized to demonstrate how to establish a connection, retrieve the network hierarchy, and print the information in a structured manner.

## Getting Started

Ensure that you have imported necessary modules from the Zepben library.

```python
from zepben.evolve import SyncNetworkConsumerClient, connect_insecure
```

## Establish Connection

Ensure that you have connected to the EWB Server. In this example, the `connect_insecure` function is used to connect to the EWB Server.

```python
channel = connect_insecure(host="EWB Hostname", rpc_port=1234)
```

You will need to replace the host and port with the appropriate values for your environment.
More information about connecting to the EWB Server using different methods can be found in the [Connecting to the EWB Server](https://zepben.github.io/evolve/docs/python-sdk/next/sdk-consumer#connecting-to-a-server) guide.

## Create a Consumer Client

After establishing the connection, create a `SyncNetworkConsumerClient` using the provided channel.

```python
client = SyncNetworkConsumerClient(channel=channel)
```

## Fetch and Display Network Hierarchy

You can fetch the network hierarchy by calling the `get_network_hierarchy` method on the `SyncNetworkConsumerClient` instance.
Once you have fetched the network hierarchy, you can iterate through the hierarchical structure and print information about each level (that is the geographical regions, sub-geographical regions, substations, and feeders).
In this example, indentation is used to help represent the hierarchical relationships clearly.

```python
network_hierarchy = client.get_network_hierarchy()
print("Network hierarchy:")
for gr in network_hierarchy.result.geographical_regions.values():
print(f"- {gr.name}")
for sgr in gr.sub_geographical_regions:
    print(f"  - {sgr.name}")
    for sub in sgr.substations:
        print(f"    - {sub.name}")
        for fdr in sub.feeders:
            print(f"      - {fdr.name}")
```
