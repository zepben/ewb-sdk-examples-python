Sometimes you do not want to pull a model from the EWB server, and instead want to build it locally.
This tutorial demonstrates how to build a model locally. In this example, we will build the IEEE 13 node test feeder (shown below) using the `zepben.evolve` framework.
The detailed information about the IEEE 13 node test feeder can be found [here](https://cmte.ieee.org/pes-testfeeders/resources/).
